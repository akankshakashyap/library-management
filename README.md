# library-management
Software Engineering course assignment.

Our institute needs to maintain a database for library management system. The database will store  information like book name, author's name, id, issue status (available or issued), student id (if issued),  due date (if issued), fine (@Rs.5/day after 15 days of book issue). 
In addition to this the administration also needs to perform the following tasks on the database:

1. It allows the admin to add, delete, update (id etc.) and edit (issue or return) the book's  information. 
2. It allows to admin to view the books issued to a particular student. 
3. It allows the user to search information of a particular book using their unique identification  number. 
4. It should allow the user to check status of books he has issued.  

It should not allow a student to issue more than 4 books at a time. Also, if at the time of return of books  due date is crossed output the applicable fine.
